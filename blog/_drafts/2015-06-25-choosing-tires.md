One important rule is to choose new tires that have a similar speed rating to the original tires that came on the car. Still, there are many types of tires to choose from. Here are the pros and cons of many common tire types.

* All-Season Tires are best for year-round traction. Pros are that they have long tread wear and offer a comfortable ride. Cons are that they lack precise handling and cornering grip.
* Performance All-Season Tires have better handling and cornering grip but often have shorter tread life.
* Ultra High Performance Tires give great grip and handling but have shorter tread life AND a less comfortable ride.
* Winter Tires perform better than All-Season Tires in cooler temperatures but become so soft and flexible in warmer temperatures that handling, traction, and wear are negatively affected.
