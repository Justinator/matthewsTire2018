Think about it. When was the last time that you took a close look at your car’s headlights? Chances are, unless you had a headlight that was not working, it probably has been a while.

Slushy, salty roads can wreak havoc on headlights in winter, but dust, bugs and tar can be equally tough on headlights during the other seasons. In addition, pollution, car wash chemicals, even ultra-violet light from the sun can take its toll on headlights making them yellowed and clouded.

Many people don’t realize the safety hazard created by poorly maintained headlights. In fact, keeping your headlights clean is as important as keeping your windshield clean. Cloudy, dirty headlights can be outright dangerous to you, your family and other drivers.

Having Matthews Tire perform headlight restoration on your vehicle can create a dramatic difference in the effectiveness of your headlights. Not only will you be able to see the road better, but other drivers will be able to see you better as well.

Ask a Matthews Tire professional about our headlight restoration service and enjoy the road in a whole new light.
