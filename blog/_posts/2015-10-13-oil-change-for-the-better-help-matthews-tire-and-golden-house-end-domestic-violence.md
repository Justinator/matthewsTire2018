Matthews Tire™ is hosting another *Oil Change for the Better* event October 19-24 at our six retail locations. For every regular-priced oil change performed throughout the week, we will donate $5 to [Golden House](http://www.goldenhousegb.org/)&mdash;a program providing safety and support for domestic abuse victims. October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

“We are so grateful to community partners, like Matthews Tire, who work with us to raise awareness, fund services, and say "NO MORE" to domestic abuse in our community,” said Koren Bandoch, Communications & Development Coordinator, Golden House Inc.

Golden House is a secure place where victims of domestic abuse find compassionate, knowledgeable advocates offering confidential, individualized help, including counseling, temporary shelter, 24-hour helpline, legal assistance, support groups, transitional housing, prevention education and more.

*Oil Change for the Better* is Matthews Tire’s semi-annual, weeklong charity event. This will be the seventh *Oil Change for the Better*. In the last three years, we’ve raised $15,000 for local non-profits including Fox Valley Humane Society, Make-A-Wish Foundation, Salvation Army, Disabled American Veterans, Catalpa Health’s *Race for a Reason* and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northeastern Wisconsin.  

Make an appointment and help us help victims of domestic abuse!
