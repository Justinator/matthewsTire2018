Rick attended Fox Valley Technical College and previously worked for Bridgestone/Firestone before joining Matthews Tire in 2000. In his position as store manager he gets great satisfaction from helping customers—many for the past 18 years. When he is not working he enjoys archery and spending time on his bike. Rick and his exceptionally supportive wife, Mary, live in Greenville.

Rick is happy to be a long-term part of Matthews Tire. “It’s a great feeling to see our customers’ grown children bringing their cars in for repairs. They really trust us,” says Rick. Visit Rick and his staff at our Appleton East store for name brand tires, expert service, scheduled maintenance and repairs for most passenger cars and light trucks.
