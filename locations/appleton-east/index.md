The Appleton East Matthews Tire store holds an annual car show—featuring classic cars from all eras—and supports many local high school and community sports teams. Through Matthews Tire’s twice annual *Oil Change for the Better* event, the Appleton East store has supported many local charities including Childcare Resource & Referral, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and Saving Paws Animal Rescue.

This location is close to Liberty Hall, Valley Grand Cinema, Sky Zone, the *Heart of the Valley* YMCA and several restaurants. It is especially convenient for those in Darboy and Kimberly.


Quality tires, incredible service and a commitment to exceeding our customers’ expectations … that’s how *We Keep You Rolling.*™
