The Waupaca Matthews Tire store supports local little league teams and Waupaca High School sports with Matthews Tire private label bottled water donations. The school has raised over $7500 by reselling the donated water at sporting events! Additionally, through Matthews Tire’s twice annual *Oil Change for the Better* event, the Waupaca store has supported many local charities including Old Glory Honor Flight, Make-A-Wish Foundation and Walleyes for Kids.

The Waupaca location, in the heart of Waupaca, is close to the famous Chain-of-Lakes and near the city of Weyauwega and village of Iola, well known for the annual Iola Car Show. It’s a convenient destination for people from the entire surrounding area.


Quality tires, incredible service and a commitment to exceeding our customers’ expectations … that’s how *We Keep You Rolling.*™
