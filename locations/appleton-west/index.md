The Appleton West Matthews Tire store enjoys a close relationship with Xavier, Appleton West, Fox Valley Lutheran and other area high schools. In addition, the location supplies bottled water and supports local sports teams such as Legion and Grand Chute baseball and other area sports teams. Through Matthews Tire’s twice annual *Oil Change for the Better* event, the Appleton West store has supported many local charities including Childcare Resource & Referral, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and Saving Paws Animal Rescue.

This location is close to the Johnston-Blessman Post 38 of the American Legion Club (with their well-known vintage war plane and Army tank display) and approximately a mile from Fox Cities Stadium as well as numerous area restaurants, stores and businesses along College Ave.

Quality tires, incredible service and a commitment to exceeding our customers’ expectations … that’s how *We Keep You Rolling.*™
