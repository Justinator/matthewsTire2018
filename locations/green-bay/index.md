The Green Bay Matthews Tire store enjoys a close relationship with the automotive departments at the Green Bay high schools as well as Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC). Through Matthews Tire’s twice annual *Oil Change for the Better* event, the Green Bay store has supported many local charities including Golden House, Old Glory Honor Flight and Make-A-Wish Foundation.

The Green Bay store is close to PDQ Carwash, Applebee’s, Noodles & Company and a plethora of other restaurants, shopping and local businesses on Oneida Street in Ashwaubenon.

Quality tires, incredible service and a commitment to exceeding our customers’ expectations … that’s how *We Keep You Rolling.*™
