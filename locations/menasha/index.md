The Menasha Matthews Tire store enjoys a close relationship with the automotive departments at Menasha High School and Neenah High School and supports local school fundraising efforts as well as participating in Fox Valley Technical College’s (FVTC) internship program. Through Matthews Tire’s twice annual *Oil Change for the Better* event, the Menasha store has also supported many local charities including Childcare Resource & Referral, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and Saving Paws Animal Rescue.

One of the unique draws to the Menasha store are the zero-clearance maintenance bays allowing them to work on even the lowest vehicles. The Menasha location is close to Xperience Fitness, Shopko and several area restaurants. It is centrally located and convenient for those living in Menasha or Appleton. 

Quality tires, incredible service and a commitment to exceeding our customers’ expectations … that’s how *We Keep You Rolling.*™
