The Fond du Lac Matthews Tire store supports many local school’s educational, sports and fundraising efforts, including the Moraine Park Technical College’s (MPTC) auto repair program as well as the Blue Line Hockey Club and the local United Way. Through Matthews Tire’s twice annual *Oil Change for the Better* event, the Fond du Lac store has also supported many local charities including Old Glory Honor Flight, Make-A-Wish Foundation and Walleyes for Kids.

The Fond du Lac location on Johnson St. is close to Friar Tuck’s and Gino’s Italian Restaurant. It is centrally located and convenient for those living in Fond du Lac, North Fond du Lac, Oakfield, Campbellsport and the surrounding areas.

Quality tires, incredible service and a commitment to exceeding our customers’ expectations … that’s how *We Keep You Rolling.*™
